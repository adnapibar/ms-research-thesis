## Masters Thesis


This repository contains the source code of my thesis and research project done as part of it.
The aim of the project was to use the VicRoads traffic volume data using the SCATS system for
making future predictions.


The project root directory is structured into following sub-directories.

- code: This directory contains the code for the project. The code mainly consists of individual
        scripts written in Python, R and MATLAB.

- data: This directory contains a zipped version of SCATS Volume data for 10 locations only. The
        zip file contains - volume_data.csv:  where the rows are site locations and the columns
        are observations at every 15 minutes interval. There are missing recordings where the
        value is 0, that could be because of a malfunction in the sensor.

- latex-thesis: This directory contains the LaTex code for the thesis
