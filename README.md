# Research project - masters thesis


This project contains the source code and data of my research project done as part of my masters
thesis. The project root directory is structured into following sub-directories.

- code: This directory contains the code for the project. The code mainly consists of individual
        scripts written in Python, R and MATLAB.

- data: This directory contains a zipped version of SCATS Volume data for 10 locations only. The
        zip file contains - volume_data.csv:  where the rows are site locations and the columns
        are observations at every 15 minutes interval. There are missing recordings where the
        value is 0, that could be because of a malfunction in the sensor.

- latex-thesis: This directory contains the LaTex code for the thesis

- plots: As the name suggests this directory contains various plots as part of the analysis.
