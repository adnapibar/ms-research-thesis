We chose a subset of the obtained traffic data for experimentation as shown in the figure
\ref{fig:ExperimentRegion}. The region boundary of the subnetwork is denoted by the red line.

\subsection{Training details}
We trained our stacked LSTM network(\ref{sec:stackedLSTMTrafficPred})

\section{Results}

For comparison purose we used the following methods that have been in used predominantly in short
term traffic prediction - Na誰ve, Linear regression, ARIMA, Exponential smoothing and Feedforward
neural network. In figure \ref{fig:benchmarkModels}, we present the predictions of these models
on test data. The input sequence was set to 96 observations(1 day) and the prediction was done for
next 15 minutes(1 step ahead).

In table \ref{table:accuracyScores}, the performance of the LSTM network along with the compared
models are given.

Several accuracy measures exist to evaluate a model. In below secions we describe
the accuracy mesures and use those to evalute our proposed model against the benchmark models.
For defining the accuracy measures let us denote $x_{i}$ be the $i^{th}$ observation and
$\hat{x}_{i}$ be the prediction of $x_{i}$.

\textbf{Scale-dependent errors}
The prediction error is simply given by $e_{i} = x_{i} - \hat{x}_{i}$, which is in the same scale
as of the original data. So accuracy measures that depend on $e_{i}$ are scale dependent and can
not be used across multiple series on different scales. The two most used scale-dependent
accuracy measures are mean absolute error and root mean squared error defined as below

    \begin{equation}
        MAE = mean(\abs{e_{i}})
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        RMSE = \sqrt{mean(e^{2}_{i})}
    \end{equation}

MAE is easy to understand and popular in usage when using a single dataset.

\textbf{Percentage errors}
Percentage errors are scale-independent and thus used across multiple datasets on different
scales. The percentage error is given by $p_{i} = 100*e_{i}/x_{i}$. The most commonly used
percentage measure is Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) which is given by the below formula
    \begin{equation}
        MAPE = mean(\abs{p_{i}})
    \end{equation}

There are however few shortccomings of the MAPE, for instance when $x_{i}$ is 0 or very large.
Another shortcoming is that they put heavier penalty on negative error values than positve error
values.

\textbf{Scaled errors}
\citet{hyndman2006another} proposed scaled errors to be used as an alternative in place of
percentage errors. The proposed Mean Absolute Scaled Error(MASE) is defined as

    \begin{equation}
        MASE = mean(\abs{q_{i}})
    \end{equation}

where
    \begin{equation}
        q_{i} = \frac{e_{i}}{\frac{1}{T-1} \displaystyle\sum_{t=2}^{T}\abs{x_{t} - x_{t-1}}}
    \end{equation}

A scaled error is less than one if it is better than the average na誰ve forecast computed on the
training data and vice versa.
